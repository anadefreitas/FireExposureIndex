## Using the dashboard
### Home

1. We have the map with the spatial layout of exposure to fire, and the radar graphics of the dimensions of the index (fire, landscape, climate and management) with information from all cells.

2. It is possible to zoom the map to the region of interest and select a cell to filter the values of the indicators that compose it. The FEI value is also filtered for the cell, as shown in red in the bottom left corner.
